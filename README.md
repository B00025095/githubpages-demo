# githubpages-demo


here is a link to the proejct's [Github pages site](https://dr-matt-smith.github.io/githubpages-demo/)


I recommend you create a `/docs` folder in your `master` branch - I think it's the simplest way to create a Github pages site for your project
(and set a theme in your repo **Settings**)

I learnt about Github pages at some of these sites:

- https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/
